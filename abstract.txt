obstacle avoidance robot is a 4 wheeled robot
used to detect and obstacle using ultrasonic sensor
and over come the obstacle.
we know the speed of the ultrasonic waves and we will know the 
time at wich it bounces back from the obstacle from these data we will find out the 
distance travelled.
we used a servo motor to rotate the ultrasonic sensor in 180 degrees
